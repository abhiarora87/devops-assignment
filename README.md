## The premise ##

* As part of my learning, I am looking to develop a simple Python API while Using the following Flask repo:
* https://github.com/abhiarora87/python-api/

 

## The ask ##

* To containerize the Flask API 
* To build Infra to deploy the app using ECS using Terraform
* Create a bash script for deployment to AWS (build and push to ECR) with a health check
   * simple automation using CM tools like Ansible
* Provide a simplified playbook (with arch diagram), demonstrating the things delivered
